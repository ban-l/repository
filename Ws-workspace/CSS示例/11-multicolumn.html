    Although computer screens are getting wider, studies still show that people have difficulty reading long lines of
    text. (Roughly 65 to 75 characters per line is generally considered a comfortable length to read.) This convention
    has led to restricted layouts and websites that don't take advantage of the opportunities wider screens
    present.<br/><br/>
    For years, magazines and newspapers have used multiple columns to flow content¡ªaddressing both the issue of long
    text lines and how to pack a lot of copy into limited spaces. Now, with the advent of the Multi-column Layout Module
    in CSS3 (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/), websites can take advantage of multiple columns, too. In this
    chapter, I'll look at the properties that have been implemented, as well as noting some that haven't. And putting
    your content into columns is not without potential issues, so I'll also address some of those as well.
